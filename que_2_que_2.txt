Que.2. Write a writup on copy by value and copy by reference?
Ans.:
  Copy By Value                         Copy By Reference
-In copy by value method original      -In copy by reference method original
value is not modified.                  value is modified.

-In copy by value ,a copy of variable  -In copy by reference ,actual variable 
is passed.                              is passed.  

-In copy by value actual and formal    -In copy by reference, actual and formal 
variables are created in different      variables are created in same
memory locations.                       memory locations.

-In copy by values we cannot alter     -In copy by reference, we can alter the values 
the values of actual variables through  of actual variables through function calls. 
function calls.

Que.3.How to copy by value a composite datatype.
Ans.: 
There are three methods to copy by value a composite datatype.

1)Using the spread(...)operator.
Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. 
It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. 
It will be a shallow copy.
Code:

 var a=[1,2,3];
 var c =[...a];
 c[1]= 10;
 console.log(a,c);
 
O/p-[ 1, 2, 3 ] [ 1, 10, 3 ]

2)Using the Object.assign() method.
The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source 
objects to a target object.It will be a shallow copy.The initial '[]' ensures
that one can't change the original object.

code:
 var a= [1,2,3];
 var b = Object.assign([],a);
 b[2]=10;
 console.log(a,c);

O/p-[ 1, 2, 3 ] [ 1, 2, 10 ]

3)Using JSON.Stringify() and JSON.parse() method.
We perform copy by value by using JSON.stringity() and then using JSON.parse().
This is a deep copy.

code:
 var a= [1,2,3];
 var b = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(a));
 b[0]=10;
 console.log(a,c);

O/p-[ 1, 2, 3 ] [ 10, 2, 3 ]
